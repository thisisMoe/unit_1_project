          Since its inception, GCash has focused on its singular goal of providing purpose-driven financial technology
          to
          empower the underserved. Yet, despite being one of the country's first movers in mobile payments, they faced
          some challenges in communicating the level of innovation they continue to achieve and pursue. This is when
          they
          asked for our help. They needed to refresh the entire GCash brand through an adaptable, robust design system,
          that connects their audience to their mission and their message, in a culture that is still apprehensive
          towards
          modern fintech.

        <p class="">
          Designing the system required that we strike the balance between being practical and being creative. It needed
          to be a flexible branding system that can keep up with an ever-growing product.
        </p>
        <p>
          The system is made up of 4 levels of illustrations, from the most basic system icons to those that are more
          detailed and more functional. The levels then move up to lifestyle-specific illustrations to those that are
          scenic and persona-centric. </p>

        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/p1-4.png" alt="">
      </div>

      <p class="">
        Apart from the foundational elements, the most complex illustration level utilizes characters developed to
        reflect
        the different lifestyles of a mobile life, set in an environment of larger than life illustrations that show
        what
        GCash can do for you.

          Finally, all that was left was to announce the rebrand. GCash engaged us once again to write, storyboard,
          illustrate, animate and even score our vision of how to tell their story. It was the culmination of almost 2
          years of collaboration — a summary of the development of GCash itself and the public's first look at the
          application of the design system on the brand's new identity.

          <div class="col-sm-6 mb-4">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/p1-5.png" alt="">
          </div>
          <div class="col-sm-6">
            <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/p1-6.png" alt="">

        <div class="d-none d-sm-block">

        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        All in all, the GCash rebrand was a long journey of getting to know the brand, what it really stands for, and
        what
        it wants to be for people. To design a good brand experience, we set out to reframe the question of “How do I as
        a
        brand stand out?” to “How will my users and stakeholders interact with us in an easier, comfortable and
        understandable way?”
      </p>
      <img class="img-fluid d-sm-none my-4" src="assets/p1-7.png" alt="">
      <p>
        From there, we were able to make better aesthetic decisions that help make GCash an easy brand to recognize,
        trust
        and understand. Through this, design becomes a deeper and long-lasting way of communicating the core of the
        brand,
        rather than an arbitrary change of visuals to look trendy and new. Ultimately, as a design-team led by purpose,
        working with likeminded GCash also helped us design with depth and intention to make a meaningful, human
        experience out of the future of money.
